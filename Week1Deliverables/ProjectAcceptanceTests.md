- **Initial setup on different devices with a set list of researches:** 	Start the program on multiple devices to see if setup is consistent
- **Load after setup:**	Once initial setup has been completed, run the program again and make sure timestamp of last updated has changed and if things need to be updated                         since last timestamp it'll update database correctly.
