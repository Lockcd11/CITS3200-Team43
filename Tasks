# a basic list of tasks to separate the workload on commencement of development of sprint 1

Back End
- creating an algorithm to convert a database (structure TBD) into a basic network structure
- add functionality for the application of filters to the database carrying through to the network 
- creating functions for the (almost) real time display of the network as the user adds and removes filters
      - giving each node margins so its a certain distance from the others
      - methods for adding and deleting nodes (can link this to database)
- creating a web application (flask?) to display the network
- * possibly add functionality for the filtered network to be printed back into a list for the user to print out

Front End
- formatting the network so it has a standardised, aesthetic and simplistic look
- adding ergonomic menu functionality to the web app for efficient user interaction
